# [L07: Binary Addition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rOxBrFifkuemZBPvCbzykaGYSfOBPXEOsOnQdRglk_g/edit?usp=sharing)

## This lab is designed to give you familiarity with an important aspect 
## of binary arithmetic, namely adding 1 or incrementing which sometimes 
## results in the propagation of a carry through the bits. 
## Starter files have been provided for you in C++

## *FIXME: Author(s) of primary logic and code: add name(s) here*

1. **WHITEBOARD DESIGN**
*Write a high level design plan for your program.
You can use screenshots of your work on an actual white board 
or you can use pseudocode.*

*FIXME*

2. **ASSIGNED TASKS**
*List who will implement each of new components of the main 
and each class method. Be careful to keep this equitable. 
It is NOT okay to have one person do the majority of the work.*


| **Name**                       | **Task**  
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------- 
| FIXME                          |  FIXME  | 
| FIXME                          |  FIXME 
| FIXME                          |  FIXME 
| FIXME                          |  FIXME 
| FIXME                          |  FIXME          

3. **ARROW NOTATION**
*Explain the significance of the arrow (->) notation 
for the nodes of the C++ linked list.*

*FIXME*
 
4. **LINKED LIST ORDER**
*The binary representation has the head of the linked list 
as the least significant bit (i.e. the number 13 in base 10 
is represented as 1->0->1->1-None.) 
Identify one significant advantage this representation has with regards 
to how this number can be incremented.*

*FIXME*

5. **OTHER REPRESENTATIONS**
*There are typically many design choices that could be made in 
terms of data structures that can be used for a given task. 
Identify two other possible data structures you that one might alternatively 
use to represent a binary number. For each, determine whether 
you think that adding would be easier and why.*

*FIXME*

6. **LEAST SIGNIFICANT BIT**
*Notice the convert_decimal_to_binary() method refers to the 
leastSignificantBit instance variable only in the first half 
of the method, and the rest referred to  bitRef. 
Explain why the method still works even though it does not 
refer to leastSignificantBit all the time.*

*FIXME*

7. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process, 
including how much your initial design plan evolved, 
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent 
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results. 
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

*FIXME*

8. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered 
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the 
lab easier for you.*

*FIXME*

9. **INNOVATIONS**
*Please briefly describe any innovations that were not 
specifically required by the assignment.*

*FIXME*

10. **BIG O ANALYSIS**
*Complete a Big-O analysis for the increment() method as you 
implemented it, explaining the computation.*

*FIXME*

11. **TESTING**
*Please briefly describe your testing process. 
Here you should be careful to select representative input cases, 
including both representative typical cases as well as extreme cases.*

*FIXME*

12. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors 
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

- *FIXME*

10. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments 
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

*FIXME*

11. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*Please briefly describe ALL help you received and 
all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references below.*
